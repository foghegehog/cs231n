# cs231n
This repo contains solutions for assignments from Stanford CS course CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, Spring 2019. Course details can be found on the course page: [http://cs231n.github.io](http://cs231n.github.io/) 
The solutions are exposed for portfolio purposes only, copying instead of implementation by oneself is prohibited. As the repo does not contain the master branch, it isn't indexed by search engines.
All rights belong to Stanford University and the course authors (along with praise and gratitude).
